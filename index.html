    <h2>"Olympic-style" Weightlifting</h2>
    <p id="weightlifting">The sport of weightlifting involves the technical application of power in moving a heavily loaded barbell from the ground to a stable overhead position.  Weightlifting is often confused for other activities such as the sport of power lifting, bodybuilding, or simply recreational lifting of free weights.  Referring to the sport of weightlifting as “Olympic-style” weightlifting helps to disambiguate.  However, only the most elite weightlifters in the world substantiate this name by competing in the Olympics.</p>

      <h3>Snatch</h3>
      <p>The snatch is the first of the two contested lifts in the sport.  Generally, athletes will have a wider grip on the bar for this in order to shorten the distance it has to travel to end up overhead.  Lifters need to pull the bar all the way into the overhead receiving position without any downward motion of the bar before they begin descending under.  A commonly broken rule involves the lifter having to press the bar up if they do not catch it with their elbow fully locked out.</p>

      <h3>Clean and jerk</h3>
      <p>This lift is almost always heavier than the snatch for individuals, as they are able to stop the bar on their chest/shoulders on its way to the overhead position.  The clean involves pulling the&#160;bar from the ground into the "front rack" or a shelf created by the lifter's shoulders and chest (and possibly clavicles!).  They must recover the clean by standing from the catch position and pause briefly before initiating the jerk.  The jerk involves using hip/leg drive to thrust the bar overhead while the athlete lowers their center of mass into the catch position.  Some athletes power jerk, or push under into a partial squat with a square stance.  Similarly, 'squat jerkers' travel under their jerks in a square stance, but catch the bar in a much lower 'squatting' catch&#160;position.  Probably the most common type of jerk is the split jerk.  A split jerk receiving position involves one foot forward and one backward in a 'split'.  A clean and jerk is only complete when the athlete's hips, knees, and shoulders are fully extended with the weight stable overhead and feet together.  Similar to the snatch, jerks may not involve a rebending and pressing of the elbow after the bar is 'caught' overhead.  An interesting rule for the clean prohibits any part of the arm/elbow contacting the leg/knee during the catch and recovery of the clean.</p>
